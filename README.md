# Lo-Fi Cafe / Project #2: The Store

This website is for the second project in my Software Engineering program at Per Scholas.

I chose to go with a lo-fi music themed store because ever since I began studying software engineering, this is what I am usually listening to when I am studying or working on assignments. To me, it is the perfect background music for studying because it gives off a calming, relaxing vibe; and is not distracting. I imagined myself visitng a place like this that had a slow paced and dark ambiance where I could soak into a comfortable seat and just settle down for a bit after a long day. Aa place i could enjoy a moment just to.. like my slogan says,"Savor the flavors and the sounds".
