# Lo-Fi Cafe / Project #2: The Store

## Introduction and Motivation
This website is for the second project in my Software Engineering program at Per Scholas.

I chose to go with a lo-fi music theme because ever since I began studying software engineering, this is what I am usually listening to when I am studying or working on assignments. To me, it is the perfect background music for studying because it gives off a calming, relaxing vibe, and is not distracting. I imagined myself visitng a place like this that had a slow paced and relaxing ambiance where I could soak into a comfortable seat and just settle down for a bit after a long day. A place where I could enjoy a moment just to.. like my slogan says,"Savor the flavors and the sounds".
 
## Cafe Tour - My 7 RESTful Routes (INDUCES)

### Default Features
All routes begins with a navigation bar at the top and the cafe's logo underneath it. Users can navigate to the home, menu and create a new meal pages using the nav bar. Clicking on the logo will also direct you to the homepage.

### Home Route
Landing on the homepage will automatically play a Lo-fi song that I thought was fitting for the page. The controls for the audio are underneath the logo with options to pause, play, seek and adjust the volume of the song. In green text is the slogan for the cafe followed by a welcome message to our guest. At the bottom of the page are images that can be used buttons. The first is to view the Menu and the other is to Create a new item for our menu.
